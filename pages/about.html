        <p>At Another Little Pizza My Heart, we specialize in simple, classic pizzas but also have some interesting new ideas. We put love into all our pizzas and use the best ingredients we can get our paws on.</p>
        <h1>Our Story</h1>
        <p>It all started in the backyard of our house. "Why do we have to go out to get great pizza?". After experimenting with the recipes for some time, we finally felt we had a great pizza on our hands. From there, we wanted our friends to share good times as well. Pizza brings people together, so we just took that concept and ran with it.</p>
        <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <p>We like to think local, so we get our ingredients from places we know and trust. Great tasting pizza starts with good ingredients. Our sauce is made fresh without preservatives. The dough is hand tossed. Our veggies are fresh (even if they might be a little ugly before they’re cut up) and our meats are locally sourced.</p>
        <h1>Mixology</h1>
        <p>We believe the classic cheese and pepperoni are staples of the pizza world. We’ve tried our best to get these right and believe that people will love them. In addition, we like to experiment because pizza can be fun and interesting as well (we’re definitely on the pro pineapple side of the debate). If you’re feeling adventurous, we’ll usually have an interesting item on our menu. For example, our Nashville Hot Pizza which comes with spicy popcorn chicken.</p>
        <h1>Locations</h1>
        <p>Currently we’re on the move so we bring our oven where it’s needed. You can follow us on social media to find out where we’ll be and when.</p>
